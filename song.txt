Say whatever you want about her
She never cut me out
Say whatever you want about her
She never cut me out
(I wouldn't let her)

When I wasn't alone
I knew what I'd done wrong
I fell asleep with the football on
And put the cushion under the alarm

And shall I wake from Dreams
For the Glory of Nothing
For the cracking of the Sun
For the crawling down of Lies?
And if We fall from Dreams

Shall we push them into Darkness
And stare into the Howling
And clamber into Night?
